# bolivier Web

A Leiningen template for me to use for web projects

#### It includes

* Aleph for http
* Reitit for routing
* graphql (via Lacinia)
* Postgresql support w/ next.jdbc
* HoneySQL
* Mount
* Shadow-CLJS

## Usage

To start the server, launch a repl, you should find yourself in the `user` ns.

From there run

```

Then, to build the frontend, go to a terminal and run:

```
shadow-cljs watch frontend
```
